#     summary: |
#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

Hi! I'm Eric, a PhD candidate at [The Australian National University](https://rsaa.anu.edu.au/people/eric-muller), researching machine learning methods for predicting cold gas fractions from HI emission spectra, under [Dr. Hiep Nguyen](https://rsaa.anu.edu.au/people/dr-hiep-nguyen). I'm particularly interested in machine learning methods for quantifying the uncertainties on predictions and using these for real science. In 2023 I finished my Honours in astrophysics at the ANU, where I worked on characterising the spatial variations of dust in galaxies from the [MAGPI](https://magpisurvey.org/index.html) and [SAMI](https://sami-survey.org/) surveys, under [Dr. Andrew Battisti](https://sites.google.com/view/ajbattisti/home).
