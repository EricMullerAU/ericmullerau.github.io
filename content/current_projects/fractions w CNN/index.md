A project using Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks to predict the CNM, UNM, and WNM fractions of HI spectra. Specifically looking at a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with Bayesian CNN weights and biases for stochastic predictions to provide error bounds on predicted values. Currently refining the architecture and investigating skip connections, as well as the need for Bayesian Transformer weights.
