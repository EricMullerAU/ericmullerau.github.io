MSIM is the MAVIS fork of the open-source HARMONI-ELT/HSIM tool. MSIM takes high spectral and spatial resolution input data cubes, encoding physical descriptions of astrophysical sources, and generates mock observed data cubes. The simulations incorporate detailed models of the sky, telescope, instrument, and detectors to produce realistic mock data.
